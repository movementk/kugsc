							<p>
							    The Global Services Center is offering language exchange program during the semester for students who wish to boost their Korean language as well as teach local students their languages and culture.<br>
							    A language exchange involves two speakers of different languages who practice these languages together. For example, a student who is fluent in Chinese may want to practice her Korean. She will then be paired with KU local student who also wants to practice Chinese. In this way, both students learn and assist. Language exchange partners have the independence to structure their meetings according to their needs.<br>
							    This is a one-on-one program where the center matches students based on their study plan and language preferences. Please be advised that this is a voluntary program.

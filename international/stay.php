					<h4 class="title">Applying for Alien Registration Card</h4>
					<p>
					    Students who have already obtained student visa (D-2) and arrived in the country must apply for Alien Registration Card (ARC) within the 90days from the arrival date. While this regulation is imposed by the immigration, we would like to advise our students to apply for ARC before the orientation week of each semester.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Alien Registration Card, once obtained will act as student visa (D-2) and Identification to who are already in Korea. It is illegal to stay in Korea for more than 90 days without being registered, regardless of your visa at entry.

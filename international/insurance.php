							<p>
							    You need to carry your ‘Medical Benefit Eligibility Verification Card’ and show it at the reception and billing counter of the designated hospitals and clinics. You will be able to get a discount on your medical treatment charges on the spot.

							<p class="note">
							    Medical benefits are applicable only when you are currently enrolled at Korea University. The Maximum amount of  benefits per semester is 2,000,000 KRW (400,000 KRW for outpatients, 1,600,000 KRW for inpatients), and a total of 2,000,000 KRW can be received per semester for the same illness.
							</p>
							<p class="note">
							    In case of an emergency or other circumstances where a student does not possess his/her verification card, he/she must at least inform the hospital that he/she is attending Korea University and follow the procedures as directed by them.

                        All students, including freshmen are required to have a visa from Korean embassy or consulate office in order to enter Korea. The D-2 visa application will require, among other things, a Certificate of Admission from Korea University and documents showing your financial support (bank statement with letter of financial support from parents or other sponsors if applicable). If you submit certificate of admission to an embassy or a consulate office, they may give D-2 visa without looking at other documents or they may ask for additional documents since it is sole right of embassies to give visa. It is advised that students must contact embassy whether they require any additional documents prior to their application for D-2 visa.<br><br>
                        Applying for a student visa can be a complicated process. Students who are already in Korea can apply directly at Sejongno immigration office while those from overseas must visit the nearest Korean Embassy or consulate office. Students who wish to apply through Sejongo immigration must make online reservation at <a href="http://hikorea.go.kr" target="_blank">http://hikorea.go.kr</a> one month prior to the visit.

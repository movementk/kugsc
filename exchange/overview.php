                    <h4 class="title">Period of Study</h4>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <ul class="dot-list">
                        <li>Full academic year: March ~ December / September ~ June</li>
                        <li>Spring semester: March ~ June</li>
                        <li>Fall Semester: September ~ December</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="title">Credit Transfer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exchange/visiting students can take max 19 credits per semester. Academic credits earned through this program can be transferred under the exchange regulations and used to satisfy degree requirements at home institutions. Visiting students must check with their home institution regarding the credit acceptability of chosen courses. For each student who has completed his/her courses successfully, a certified transcript of academic performance will be sent to the student’s home institution upon request.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="title">Assessment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Each student’s academic performance is graded according to the following criteria:<br>
                        exams and assignment results, attendance, and class participation. Students usually take regular examinations twice per semester (mid-term and final). They may also be given additional assignments by their professors. A minimum 70% of attendance is required in order for a student to earn a passing grade. Student’s performance is normally graded on a 100 point scale.
                    </p>

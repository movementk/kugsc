                    <h4 class="title">What is Student Exchange Program (SEP)</h4>
                    <p>
                        KU has established extensive links with many universities internationally through its student exchange program (SEP), which was developed as part of its internationalization process. This program now involves almost two thousand students to and from countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, North and South America.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benefits of KU exchange students vary according to the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement KU has concluded with each institution. Based on the principle of reciprocal exchange of benefits, our standard exchange agreements regulate student tuition fee waivers at host universities. However, students are responsible for their accommodation. Exchange students are also responsible for their own travel, medical insurance and other personal expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, KU entered into an agreement for student exchange with International Student Exchange Programs(ISEP), a membership organization of worldwide higher-education institutions. To apply for ISEP at KU, please consult the ISEP coordinator at your university or for more information about ISEP, please visit (<a href="www.isep.org" target="_blank">www.isep.org</a>)

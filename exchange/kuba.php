					<h4 class="title">What’s KUBA?</h4>

					    KUBA stands for Korea University Buddy Assistants and each students will have a group of KUBA members when they arrive in Korea.During each vacation period, the Global Services Center recruits KU student volunteers (mostly second year students or higher) for KUBA to guide and help Study Abroad and Exchange students adjust to Korea University life. Buddies are selected on the basis of their language abilities, student involvement (including participation in societies and clubs at KU), and in-person interviews.<br>
					    Exchange/Visiting students will be automatically registered as KUBA members and will receive e-mails from Korea University buddies before the semester starts. 
					</p>

					        <h5><span>Welcoming Party </span><i>(March, September)</i></h5>
					        <p>
					            On the first week of the new semester, KU welcomes exchange/study abroad students at this Party. Exchange/Study Abroad students have lots of opportunities to become familiar with KUBA members while promoting a mutual understanding of Korean Culture and Korea University.
					        </p>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					        <h5><span>Field Trip </span><i>(April, October)</i></h5>
					        <p>
					            Now, it is time to experience NEW Korea. Most of the students are have become accustomed to KU life around this time of the semester.

					        </p>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					        <h5><span>Annual Korea University - Yonsei University Sports Event </span><i>(September)</i></h5>
					        <p>
					            KU students join together for the annual Korea University VS Yonsei University sports event. This annual event has been likened to the Keio-Waseda match or the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race held every spring. Over the two-day period, they compete in baseball, basketball, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer. The event is made even more interesting by the contrasting traditions and academic cultures of Yonsei and Korea. As the oldest universities in the nation, both have venerable histories, a source of pride for their students. International students also share in the pride of being a Korea University student.
					        </p>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					        <h5><span>International Students' Festival </span><i>(November)</i></h5>
					        <p>
					            International students with a sense of belonging to KU through various activities previously mentioned above are encouraged to be representatives for a culture Olympics called "International Students’ Festival" At the event, international students from over 20 different countries set up booths to present the foods, clothes and games from their home countries. Approximately 500 KU and International students, including those from other domestic institutions enjoy this booth display event. At the fashion show, the second part of the festival, students will have a chance to show other students their countries’ traditional clothes.<br><br>
					            This event was first held to accelerate socialization between KU and international students and has been providing a much anticipated opportunity for both international students and KU students to break the ice with each other and to understand each country’s culture better by preparing and enjoying the event together.
					        </p>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					        <h5><span>Farewell Party </span><i>(June, December)</i></h5>
					        <p>
					            Finally, towards the end of the exchange experience, international students are invited to attend the farewell party. At the farewell party, students will receive a remembrance. This provides them with a great collection of memories of their time in at KU and Korea.
